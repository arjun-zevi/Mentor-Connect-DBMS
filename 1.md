Project: Student Mentorship App - Project Outline
Project: Student Mentorship App — Simple Project Outline

Purpose (in plain words)
- This app helps mentors and students work together. Mentors can be assigned students, set goals, schedule meetings, and add notes. Students can see their mentor, meetings, and goals. Admins manage users and assignments.

Short summary
- There are three roles: Admin, Mentor, Student.
- Backend is a Node.js server (Express) that talks to a MySQL database.
- Frontend is a React app that talks to the backend using HTTP (Axios).

What we used (simple list)
- Backend: Node.js, Express, JWT for login, MySQL connector.
- Database: MySQL (schema file in `database/schema.sql`).
- Frontend: React, React Router, Axios, plain CSS files.
- Tools: npm, PowerShell/Terminal, small Node scripts for checks.

How it works — step by step
1) Login
   - User sends email and password to `/api/auth/login`.
   - Server checks `users` table and finds the user.
   - Server adds mentor_id or student_id to the token if that profile exists.
   - Frontend saves the token and user info in localStorage.

2) Authorization
   - Every request uses the token in the `Authorization` header.
   - Middleware on the server checks the token and the user role.

3) Mentor actions (what mentors do)
- Get a list of mentees: `/api/mentors/mentees`.
- Schedule meetings: `POST /api/meetings` (needs assignment_id + date/time).
- Create goals: `POST /api/goals` (tied to an assignment).
- See dashboard stats: `/api/reports/dashboard-stats`.

4) Student actions (what students do)
- See meetings: `GET /api/meetings/student/me`.
- See goals: `GET /api/goals/student/me`.
- Mark goals done: `PUT /api/goals/:goal_id/mark`.

5) Admin actions
- Create mentors/students (`/auth/register-mentor`, `/auth/register-student`).
- Manage or remove users and assignments.

Main tables (simple explanation)
- `users` — login info (email, password, role).
- `mentors` — mentor profile (links to `users` by `user_id`).
- `students` — student profile (links to `users` by `user_id`).
- `assignments` — links mentor and student, has start/end and status.
- `meetings` — meeting records (date, time, duration, status).
- `goals` — goals set by mentors for students.
- `meeting_notes` / `general_notes` — notes added by mentors.
- `interventions` — extra support actions a mentor can create.

How the tables relate (easy)
- One `user` can be a `mentor` or `student` (one profile per user).
- One mentor can have many `assignments` (many mentees).
- One student can have many assignments over time (usually one active now).
- Each `assignment` can have many `meetings` and many `goals`.

Key API endpoints (short list)
- `POST /api/auth/login` — login
- `GET /api/mentors/mentees` — get mentor's mentees
- `POST /api/meetings` — create meeting
- `PUT /api/meetings/:meeting_id` — update meeting status
- `GET /api/meetings/student/me` — student meetings
- `POST /api/goals` — create goal
- `GET /api/goals/student/me` — student goals
- `PUT /api/goals/:goal_id/mark` — student updates goal status
- `GET /api/reports/dashboard-stats` — mentor dashboard data

Important rules to remember (simple)
- Tokens must include `mentor_id` or `student_id` so role endpoints work.
- Use `meeting_date` in SQL comparisons (don’t use a column named `date`).
- Only count `assignments` with `status = 'active'` for dashboard numbers.
- Be careful with Express routes: `/student/:student_id` can catch `/student/me` if routes are in the wrong order.

Quick tests and fixes
- If something is missing, check the network tab in the browser and server logs.
- Run small Node scripts to inspect tables (DESCRIBE or SELECT) if needed.

Quickstart (copy-paste)
1) Run the DB script in MySQL Workbench or CLI:
```powershell
mysql -u root -p
SOURCE C:/React/final\ dbms/database/schema.sql;
```
2) Start backend:
```powershell
cd "c:\dbms\final dbms\backend"
npm install
npm start
```
3) Start frontend:
```powershell
cd "c:\dbms\final dbms\frontend"
npm install
npm start
```

Short SQL examples (for slides)
- Assignments per mentor:
  SELECT mentor_id, COUNT(*) as active_count FROM assignments WHERE status='active' GROUP BY mentor_id;
- Meetings for a student:
  SELECT m.*, mt.name as mentor_name FROM meetings m JOIN mentors mt ON m.mentor_id=mt.mentor_id WHERE m.student_id = 5 ORDER BY m.meeting_date DESC;
